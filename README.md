# Gradient generator

This is a CSS gradient generator made with React(installed with Vite), and using [98.css by @jdan](https://github.com/jdan/98.css) for styling.

While developing this project I learned:
- to try and try to solve any problems I may come to. I've learned on my journey of development to focus hard when problem solving,
and the answer can be just around the corner, or the next link in the google results. 
- I also just earned my Git and Github course certificate, and used my new knowledge in this project, practicing creating branches to work on a different copy of my project to add new features and merging from the terminal, instead of relying on my (very handy) git/github VS code extension.

(This project still has bugs)
