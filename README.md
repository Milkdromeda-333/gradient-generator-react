# Gradient generator

This is a CSS gradient generator made with React(installed with Vite), and using [98.css by @jdan on github](https://github.com/jdan/98.css) for styling.

While developing this project I learned to try and try to solve any problems I may come to. I've learne on my journey of development to focus hard when problem solving,
and the answer can be just around the corner, or the net link in the google results.
